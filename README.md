# Biometric-Security-Systems-Project-Report
The project is about designing a Biometric Security System that utilizes biometric attributes, particularly fingerprints and speaker recognition, for authentication and access control. The paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using biometric attributes in security systems and explores the architecture of the proposed Biometric Security System. It focuses on fingerprint and speaker recognition as the biometric technologies. The system aims to encrypt a private cryptographic key with biometric information obtained from fingerprint and speaker recognition processes. It uses hash functions to generate biometric cryptographic keys, which are stored in a database without containing any secret information.

The paper also examines the information entropy of biometric attributes, specifically fingerprints, and estimates the upper limit of available information on a fingerprint for cryptographic purposes. It describes the steps involved in fingerprint recognition, such as image quality improvement, minutiae extraction, and verification. Similarly, the steps involved in speaker recognition, including recording, signal pre-processing, feature extraction, and recognition, are discussed.

The project concludes that biometric security systems have the potential to enhance reliability, uniqueness, and security in identification and access control. However, it also highlights some challenges, such as exactingness in acquiring certain biometric features, difficult implementation, cooperation unwillingness from users, inconstancy of biometric attributes, and the risk of fraud in obtaining biometric information illegally.

Overall, the project proposes a biometric-based security system that combines fingerprint and speaker recognition to generate cryptographic keys for authentication and access control. However, it acknowledges that biometric technology needs further development to improve reliability and performance in real-world applications.
